Here, in this repository 
all the sorting algorithms in C language are posted.
Each sorting algorithm is specified with its respective name.  

All the algorithms are compiled and run with no errors in the code.
This repository was also created to keep a track of all my learnings 
in practising and learning all these sorting algorithms. :)
